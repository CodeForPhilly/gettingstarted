Civic Hackers starter guide. A basic "readme" on good ways to ensure successful collaboration.

### Tooling

One of the most exciting part "getting started" is choosing your technology stack. But before you do that you need to make two categories.

***Human** - Tools that help me communicate, collaborate and contribute.*

***Non-Human** - Tools that help me orchestrate, automate and integrate.*

| Humans  | Non-Humans |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Slack  | Travis CI |
| Trello  | IDE  |

Alright -- So I got everything setup, but where do I put my code?
