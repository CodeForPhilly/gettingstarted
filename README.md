### Tooling

One of the most exciting part "getting started" is choosing your technology stack. But before you do that you need to make two categories.

***Human** - Tools that help me communicate, collaborate and contribute.*

***Non-Human** - Tools that help me orchestrate, automate and integrate.*

| Humans  | Non-Humans |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Slack  | Travis CI |
| Trello  | IDE  |

### Some questions for the **non-human** stuff.

Alright -- So I got everything setup, but where do I put my code?

Who is in charge of the repo?

When do I PR?

Why did someone do this?

Stop checking in things on the master branch.

### Some questions for the **human** stuff.

Alright -- So everyone is setup, what next?

Who is charge?

When do we meetup?

Why did we choose this language?

Start encouraging each other.
