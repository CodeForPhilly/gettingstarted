## Identifying Need

#### In a nutshell

The first and foremost thing to do when joining a project is to figure out what needs to be done
for the project at the present time. Identifying what tasks need to be accomplished is the best
way to identify how to have an immediate and helpful impact on a project as a contributor.

#### Reviewing onboarding material

When coming on to a new project, the best place to start is by reviewing any onboarding material.
Commond places to find onboarding material for a project include:

- README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- Project wiki

These locations often include information on how to get up and running with a development environment,
common workflow practices, locations of issue trackers, wikis, documentation, etc, and other information
which may be necessary in order to make contributions to the project.

#### Talking to active project members

Ideally, a project should have up-to-date and readily available onboarding materials for a new contributor
to review. Unfortunately though, not all projects have this information documented and published. In cases
such as these, it's best to reach out to current contributors to the project. Even when this documentation
does exist, it may be necessary to reach out to active contributors to ask clarifying questions,
correct outdated information, or just to say hello so they know who they are working with!

## Communicating activity

#### In a nutshell

Being a good contributor means not leaving project teammates guessing. It is important that all team members
understand what each other team member is actively doing (or not doing) so that team members can avoid stepping
on each other's toes, while still ensuring everything that needs to be done is done.

#### What your are working on

Being a good contributor means letting the team know when starting work on a new task. There are never too many channels
to keeping teammates in the loop! If the task is in the issue tracker being used by the team (which it definitely should be),
always self-assign the task when working on it, and even inform the team via the regular communication channel, whether that
be a chat channel or an email thread. Keeping the team aware of what tasks are being worked on not only helps the team avoid
duplicating efforts, but also encourages the team to see tasks being worked on.

#### What you are no longer working on

Being a good contributor means letting the team know when work on a task has stopped or stalled. Sometimes things come up;
a task can be blocked by another task, a teammate may no longer have time to work on a task, or may be simply burned out from
working on a task they don't like. Under these circumstances, a contributor should always let their teammates know that the
task is no longer being worked on, so that everyone is aware that it will need to be picked up and worked on by someone else.
If the task is being tracked in the project issue tracker (which it definitely should be) always make sure to unassign the task
so that no teammate believes it is still being worked on.

#### When you've done a thing

A lot of (personal) time gets invested in contributing to an open source project. Be proud of every little thing that gets
accomplished! Whenever a task is accomplished or something is done for the project, let the team know via the regular communication
channels (e.g., chat or email chain). Letting teammates know about accomplishments not only keeps them in the loop about what does
or does not remain to be done, but helps encourage them by showing that the project is making progress! This may be one of the most
underrated aspects of being a helpful contributor. If the task is being tracked in the project issue tracker (...you get the idea),
always make sure to mark it as completed to keep the view of the project status current.

#### Your hopes and dreams!

Investing time in helping to make a project happen means that you are part of that project! As a part of that project, you shouldn't
be shy about speaking up about your vision for its future and its mission. It's important to also remember that your vision isn't the
only one, but contributing your opinions is important in order to continue feeling invested in the project and its mission.
