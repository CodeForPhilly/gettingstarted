## Identifying Need

#### In a nutshell

The first and foremost thing to do when joining a project is to figure out what needs to be done
for the project at the present time. Identifying what tasks need to be accomplished is the best
way to identify how to have an immediate and helpful impact on a project as a contributor.

#### Reviewing onboarding material

When coming on to a new project, the best place to start is by reviewing any onboarding material.
Commond places to find onboarding material for a project include:

- README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- Project wiki

These locations often include information on how to get up and running with a development environment,
common workflow practices, locations of issue trackers, wikis, documentation, etc, and other information
which may be necessary in order to make contributions to the project.

#### Talking to active project members

Ideally, a project should have up-to-date and readily available onboarding materials for a new contributor
to review. Unfortunately though, not all projects have this information documented and published. In cases
such as these, it's best to reach out to current contributors to the project. Even when this documentation
does exist, it may be necessary to reach out to active contributors to ask clarifying questions,
correct outdated information, or just to say hello so they know who they are working with!
